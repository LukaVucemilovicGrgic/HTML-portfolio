<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Luka, I come from Osijek and I am 29 years old.<br/> 
  I graduated from mathematics high school, and I entered the Faculty of Civil Engineering, but after a few years, I realized that I was not interested in it.
  I worked various jobs as a student, plus I played football. <br/>
  This year, I started working in the IT industry and realized that this is my path.
  I believe this industry has a lot of possibilities and allows you to progress while learning new technologies.</p>
